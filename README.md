This is my (soon-to-be) submission for Ubisoft's NEXT challenge this year!

Completed:
- 3D renderer (projection, triangles, lighting, backface culling, .obj file loading, transformations, triangle clipping)
- Free camera
- Scene management for levels
- Tiny Vector3 and Matrix4x4 math library

To-do:
- Entity manager (game object creation)
- Components
- UI
- Particle system
- Audio engine
- Basic physics (mostly just collision)
- Making a simple railgun shooter before the challenge begins
